The Kids Yearn For the Mines | Fully mine an Underground layer | This means fully clear every single tile underground, mine the last treasure as your last tile or else the mine will reset and you wont get the achievement. I recommend turning off any helpers so they don't accidentally screw it up for you.

He is in Johto for regional attack purposes. With a total health of over 548 Billion you will need over 100 Billion in attack before you can win.

|Achievement Name|Unlock Requirements|Notes
|:---|:---|
Karpal Tunnel | Reach 1,000,000 attack with [[Pokémon/Magikarp]]  |Just keep breeding Magikarp. Synergies well with the "Too much Effort" Secret Achievement.

:::collapsed You Wish
|Achievement Name|Unlock Requirements|Notes
|:---|:---|
Wou Can Stop Now | Acquire 1,000 Wishing Pieces | Assuming you get all 10 Wishing Pieces each day it will take you a total of 100 days or over 3 months to get them all.

:::collapsed Red is my favorite color
|Achievement Name|Unlock Requirements|Notes
|:---|:---|
You are my best friend | Have a total of 100 [[Items/Light Ball]]s |Light Balls held by Pikachus don't count for the total. You must have 100 in your inventory for the Achievement to trigger.
:::

:::collapsed Blue is my favorite color
|Achievement Name|Unlock Requirements|Notes
|:---|:---|
Smell Ya Later | Defeat blue 1,000,000 times |If you do this afk it will take 69 days to go from 0 to 1,000,000. A much faster way is to use click attack and spam click, It will still take a long time but it will be much faster then if you just afk in the background.

:::collapsed Shrink me baby one more time
|Achievement Name|Unlock Requirements|Notes
|:---|:---|
Aren't Dungeons Fun | Clear Any dungeon 10,000 times |This will cost a lot of Dungeon Tokens so doing it with the cheapest dungeon is the best option. [[Dungeons/ Viridian Forest]] cost only 50 [[File:dungeonToken.svg\|25px]] for a total of 500,000 [[File:dungeonToken.svg\|25px]] Dungeon Tokens making it the cheapest option. You can either do this manually or hire a dungeon guide and set it to akf in the background. A dungeon guide is much slower and will cost you additional resources depending on which guide you use.

:::collapsed Some Effort required
|Achievement Name|Unlock Requirements|Notes
|:---|:---|
Super Spreader | Reach a 2x EV bonus with any Pokémon |This requires having 802 EVs for a single Pokémon, I recommended choosing a Pokémon who's has a high catch rate and can easily and quickly be encountered on mass. A good Pokémon to go for is [[Pokémon/Magikarp]] as it Synergies with The Strongest Fish Achievement.
:::

:::collapsed Too much Effort
|Achievement Name|Unlock Requirements|Notes
|:---|:---|
Error: Pokemon storage full | Reach a 3x EV bonus with any Pokémon |This requires having 40,121 EVs for a single Pokémon. This Achievement is basically a continuation of the previous one so the same advice follows here as before.
