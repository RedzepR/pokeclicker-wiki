As the player earns achievements they will receive bonuses to [[Pok√©dollars]], [[Dungeon Tokens]], and Experience from all sources. Click Attack and [[Flutes]] are also boosted by achievement bonus. The **Achievement Tracker** is unlocked after completing [[Dungeons/Victory Road]].  Any Achievement that is impossible due to active [[Challenge Modes]] will be removed and its percentage reward redistributed to the other achievements.
