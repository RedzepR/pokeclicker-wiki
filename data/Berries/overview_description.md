Berries can be grown in the [[Farm]] to earn [[Farm Points]] and multiply, used to attract Wandering Pokémon, or provide special bonuses via auras.  Collected berries can be traded for specialty [[Poké Balls]], [[Vitamins]], and other Evolution Items at Berry Master shops and spent to evolve [[Pokemon/Milcery]] into Alcremies at the [[Battle Cafe]].  Common berries drop as loot from wild Pokémon, but most require setting up specific layouts on the Farm and getting a lucky mutation to a new species.

### Features
#### Related Items

The [[Oak Items/Sprayduck]], [[Oak Items/Squirtbottle]], and [[Oak Items/Sprinklotad]] are all [[Oak Items]] that speed up or otherwise improve the process of growing berries.  Mulches can be applied to berries for various effects, increasing yield, affecting growth or attracting more rare Wanderers.  [[Items/Berry Shovel]] will remove and destroy any planted berry.

#### Wanderers

Farms with at least one ripe Berry can attract [[Wandering Pokémon]]. Some Berries can attract rare Pokémon and can thus be used strategically to complete the Pokédex. Wandering Pokémon can also be shiny, capturing shiny Wandering Pokémon when the Farm has at least one empty plot is the condition for a Starf Berry to spawn on the Farm (in one of the empty plots).

### Mutations

The first eight berries are dropped by wild pokemon or looted from chests in [[Dungeons]].  Every other berry can generated through **mutation**, though many of the early mutations also appear in later regions as dungeon loot. Each berry requires specific conditions to be able to mutate, usually two or more other berries adjacent to an empty plot. Adjacencies are checked orthogonally (north, south, east, west) and diagonally (NE, SE, NW, SW).  The Kanto Berry Master in [[Towns/Cerulean City]] will give a hint daily for berries the player hasn't yet acquired.

Most berry mutations happen at the Berry (fully ripe) stage and have a chance to occur every 1.5 seconds until they die. Evolution *(a berry transforming into another)* and flavor mutations can occur starting at the Taller stage. For mutations involving flavor requirements, all berries emit flavor points beginning at the Taller stage (berries have 0.5x flavor in the Taller stage, 0.75x flavor in the Bloom stage, and 1x flavor in the Berry stage).

If the conditions for multiple mutations are met simultaneously for a given farm plot, the mutation triggered will be selected at random.

### Setups
Thanks to certain Berries having helpful auras, it's possible to use them to achieve different goals. These Setups can be found in:
- [[Hatchery]]: Setups related to Egg Step gain.
- [[Shiny Chance]]: Setups related to increasing Shiny Chance.
- [[Farm/Setups]]: Setups not contained in the previous two pages, like EV gain, or formations to speed up experience gain for the Farm Oak Items.
