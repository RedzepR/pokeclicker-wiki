Berry Masters offer [[Farm]] specific information, sell farming items for [[Farm Points]], and trade items and Pokémon for [[Berries]].

## Items for Sale {#itemsforsale}
Item prices increase with repeat purchases and decrease by harvesting Berries on the Farm. Price inflation/deflation is shared across all Berry Master shops. *(This only affects items bought with Farm Points. Berry trades do not have inflation/deflation.)*

## Berry Trades {#trades}
Berry Masters have different trade inventory and different berry requests per day. Trades always have stable prices for that day, regardless of quantity exchanged. All players have the same trades and trade prices every day.

- See [[Daily Deals]] for currently available trades.
- Visit [PokéClicker Companion](https://companion.pokeclicker.com/#!Forecast/Berry/GoldenrodCity) for forecasts and next available trade date for any specific item.

For trade balancing purposes, Berries are divided up into generations based on ID number. Equal odds are assigned to any given Berry being selected randomly.

- Generation 1 is [Cheri #1](/#!Berries/Cheri) through [Sitrus #8](/#!Berries/Sitrus)
- Generation 2 is [Persim #9](/#!Berries/Persim) through [Lum #20](/#!Berries/Lum)
- Generation 3 is [Pomeg #21](/#!Berries/Pomeg) through [Pinkan #36](/#!Berries/Pinkan)
- Generation 4 is [Occa #37](/#!Berries/Occa) through [Roseli #54](/#!Berries/Roseli)
- Generation 5 is [Snover #55](/#!Berries/Snover) and up, but limited to Berries with a total growth time of under 24 hours. ([[Berries/Micle]], [[Berries/Custap]], [[Berries/Jaboca]], [[Berries/Rowap]], [[Berries/Kee]] & [[Berries/Maranga]])
