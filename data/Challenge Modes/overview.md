:::collapsed Extra information about the challenges
#### Regional Attack Debuff
Lowers the attack of Pokémon that aren't native to the current region. The strength of the debuff is based on your highest region, not the region you are battling in. Pokémon retain 20% of their attack in Johto and this value raises by 10% each region. This challenge is activated by default.

#### Require Complete Pokédex
Requires a complete regional Pokédex before moving on to the next [Region](#!Regions). You only need one of each Pokémon to be able to move to the next region. Any form of the Pokémon is valid even if it isn't the base form. This challenge is activated by default.

#### No Click Attack
Disables the ability to use [click attacks](#!Click_Attack). You still can click in the very first battle of the game.

#### No Battle Items
Disables the usage of [[Items/X Attack]], [[Items/X Click]], [[Items/Lucky Egg]], [[Items/Token Collector]], [[Items/Dowsing Machine]], and [[Items/Lucky Incense]]. You can still buy or find these items even if you can't use them. Despite this restriction on the usage of battle items, [[Flutes]] are still able to be used and provide their +0.5% attack buff.

#### No Master Balls
Disables the usage of [Master Balls](#!Items/Master_Ball). You still can buy them, so you can complete the related achievements.

#### No Oak Items
Disables the usage of all [[Oak Items]]. The achievements related to leveling up these items will disappear, and the percentages will be distributed among the other general achievements. In order to get the [[Berries]] that mutate while using some Oak Items you can buy them at the Johto [Berry Master](#!Berry_Masters) in [[Towns/Goldenrod City]] once you have unlocked the Berry that evolves into them.

#### No Gem Upgrades
Disables the usage of [[Gems]] to increase damage multipliers. You can still get gems and use them to buy items such as [[Flutes]] or Pokémon.

#### No Vitamins
Disables the usage of [[Vitamins]]. You can still buy and find them, so the related achievements can still be completed.

#### Slow EVs
Gain [EVs](#!Pokérus) 10x times slower. If the challenge is deactivated, the EVs will get multiplied back.

#### Real Evolution
When a Pokémon evolves the base form is removed from your party. The evolved Pokémon will inherit the attack gained through breeding the base Pokémon as a flat value, as well as shiny status, [EVs](#!Pokerus), and held item (if is it compatible with the evolved Pokémon). If the Pokémon has the [Shadow status](#!Shadow_Pokémon), it will be lost upon evolving. If the Pokémon has been Purified, the evolved Pokémon will retain the 20% damage buff, transfered as a flat value. Baby Pokémon are not considered evolutions and have no impact on this challenge.
