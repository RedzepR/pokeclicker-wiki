Diamonds [[File:diamond.svg|25px]] are a currency that can be obtained in the [[Underground]] by selling certain items, from wild PokÃ©mon drops or looting chests in [[Dungeons]].  To view your Diamonds, turn on the option in **Start Menu** > **Settings** > **Display** > "Show Diamonds, Farm Points and Battle Points on main screen:"

Besides shop purchases, Diamonds are most useful for funding the wages of the two Diamond [[Hatchery Helpers]], [[Aiden]] and [[Kris]].
