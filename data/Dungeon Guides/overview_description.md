Dungeon Guides provide [dungeon](#!Dungeons) automation for an additional fee. Guides can be hired after clearing a dungeon at least ten times, and each have their own dungeon exploring pattern and wages.

### Hiring
To hire a Guide, go to the [dungeon](#!Dungeons) location and click on the circular arrow next to the "Start \<dungeon cost\> [[File:dungeonToken.svg|18px]]" button.  If the hire button is missing, clear the Dungeon 10 times manually.  The pop-up window shows all available Guides, their stats and prices.  Click the "Hire!" button to bring up a second window where the number of runs and final price will be shown.  "Start!" begins the Guide's attempts.  Do not close the game while a Guide is working, as this will forfeit all remaining attempts with **no** refunds.

The cost of using a Dungeon Guide is based on their pattern, speed, number of attempts and the base price of the Dungeon being attempted.  The more expensive the Dungeon, the higher the fee and the lower the odds of success for Guides that don't beeline to the boss.  The total cost of all attempts purchased must be paid up front when the Guide is hired.

#### Discount
Dungeon Guide's costs get a bulk discount, based on the formula below.  The more dungeon attempts that are bought at once, the bigger the percentage discount offered on the Guide's fee.  This discount does not change the Dungeon Entry Cost which is always paid in full and in addition to the Guide's fee.  There are diminishing returns making minimum orders of 50-100 runs or full sets of 500 most efficient.

$$ \text{Discount} =  \frac{(\text{Dungeon Attempts} ^.975)}{\text{Dungeon Attempts}}$$

### Controls
Dungeon Guides explore automatically, opening loot chests and battling wild Pokémon or trainers using your Pokémon team's total Attack.  [[Poké Balls]] will be thrown based on active Catch Filters.  Effects such as [[Items/Time Flute]], [[Items/Token Collector]] and [[Oak Items]] are all usable by Dungeon Guides.  Guides do not account for [Flash](#!Dungeons/#flash) or the lack thereof, relying exclusively on their own exploration pattern.
