Dungeon Guides provide [dungeon](#!Dungeons) automation for an additional fee. Guides can be hired after clearing a dungeon at least ten times, and each have their own dungeon exploring pattern and wages.

### Hiring
To hire a Guide, go to the [Dungeon](#!Dungeons) location and click on the circular arrow next to the "Start \<dungeon cost\>" button.  If the button is missing, clear the Dungeon at least 10 times manually.  The Guide menu shows all available Guides, their stats and prices.  Click the "Hire!" button to bring up a second window where the number of runs and final price will be shown.  "Start!" begins the Guide's attempts.  Do not close the game while a Guide is working, as this will forfeit all remaining attempts with **no** refunds.

### Costs
The cost of using a Dungeon Guide is based on their pattern, speed, number of attempts and the base price of the Dungeon being attempted.  The more expensive the Dungeon, the higher the fee and the lower the odds of success for Guides that don't beeline to the boss.

### Controls
Dungeon Guides explore automatically, opening loot chests and battling wild pokemon or trainers using your Pokémon team's total Attack.  [[Pokéballs]] will be thrown based on active Catch Filters.  Effects such as [[Items/Time Flute]], [[Items/Token Collector]] and [[Oak Items]] are all usable by Dungeon Guides.  Guides do not account for [Flash](#!Dungeons/#flash) or the lack thereof, relying exclusively on their own exploration pattern.
