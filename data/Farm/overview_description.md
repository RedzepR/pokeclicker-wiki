The Farm is a location unlocked in [[Regions/Kanto]] where [[Berries]] can be planted. Harvesting them yields [[Farm Points]] and more of the same type of Berry. Occasionally, mutations can occur when Berries are planted in certain configurations. The Farm is unlocked upon reaching [[Routes/Kanto Route 11]] and obtaining the Wailmer Pail.

Two [Quests](#!Quest_Points) can appear involving the usage of the Farm: gain a certain number of [[File:farmPoint.svg|25px]][[Farm Points]] or harvest specific berries. These will award [[File:questPoint.svg|25px]][[Quest Points]].

## Usage

_For a breakdown of harvest yields, flavors, and mutation configurations for the various types of Berries, consult the [[Berries]] specific pages._

The eight Gen 1 [[Berries]] are dropped by defeated Pokémon on routes. They can be planted by selecting the desired type in the left-hand column and clicking on plots in the field on the right. Alternatively, the "Plant All" button can be clicked to plant the selected Berry in every empty plot.

Depending on the type of Berry planted, different lengths of time must pass before they can be harvested. Individual plots can be clicked to be harvested, or the "Harvest All" button may be pressed to harvest every plot ready for harvesting.

When Berry plants become ripe, they will die after a set period of time if not harvested. When this happens, only 1/2 of the harvest is obtained. There is also a chance they will replant themselves, spawning a plant of the same berry in that plot. The Replant Rate can be augmented by using the [[Items/Sprinklotad]] Oak Item.

New types of Berries can be obtained by planting others in special configurations. The Kanto Berry Master in [[Towns/Cerulean City]] gives hints as to these combinations. The farm can also produce helpful effects (external [Auras](#!Berries#aura)) such as increasing egg steps for faster breeding and better shiny chance. It can also attract specific Pokémon which are referred to as [[Wandering Pokémon]].

### Locking Plots

Farm plots can be locked or unlocked by interacting with the Padlock button in the Farm modal, holding down Shift and clicking on plots, or with the Lock All, Unlock All and Flip actions from the dropdown or buttons in the Farm module window.  Flip reverses the locked/unlocked status of all plots.  Locked plots cannot be harvested, mulched, or shovelled.  They can still [mutate](#!Berries#mutation) - including being overtaken by parasite berries - wither, and have [[Wandering Pokémon]] collected from them.  [[Farm Hands]] cannot harvest or plant in locked plots, but will still manage Wanderers if hired to do so.

### Farm Hands
Farm Hands are helpers that can be hired to perform Farming tasks from the Farm Hands tab of the main Farm window.  See [[Farm Hands]] for a full explanation of their mechanics.  Most of the time Farm Hands are a net negative in terms of [[Farm Points]] income, outside of certain setups.

### Farm Items

Farming supplies can be bought from [[Berry Masters]] in [[Towns/Goldenrod City]], [[Towns/Mauville City]], [[Towns/Hearthome City]] and [[Towns/Driftveil City]], in exchange for [[Farm Points]]. Mulches can be applied to Berry plants to speed up growth ([[Items/Boost Mulch]]), increase harvest yield ([[Items/Rich Mulch]]), increase mutation chance ([[Items/Surprise Mulch]]), or all the above with a slightly reduced boost for all three ([[Items/Amaze Mulch]]). [[Items/Berry Shovel]] can be used to clear occupied plots of partially grown, unwanted Berries, while [[Items/Mulch Shovel]] will remove Mulches only from a plot.


| Name | Price | Description |
|:--------: | :--------: |:--------:|
|[[File:Boost_Mulch.png\|32px]]  [[Items/Boost Mulch]]  | 50 [[File:currency/farmPoint.svg\|24px]] | Increases Berry growth rate by 50% when applied to a plot occupied by a Berry plant. |
|[[File:Rich_Mulch.png\|32px]]  [[Items/Rich Mulch]]  | 100 [[File:currency/farmPoint.svg\|24px]] | Doubles the amount of berries gained from harvesting a ripe Berry plant. Can be applied immediately prior to harvesting a plant to gain the full doubling boost. Doubles replant chance if berry withers while mulched.  |
|[[File:Surprise_Mulch.png\|32px]]  [[Items/Surprise Mulch]] | 150 [[File:currency/farmPoint.svg\|24px]]  | Increases the chance of Berry mutations by 50% on any (can be empty or occupied) plot it is applied to. |
|[[File:Amaze_Mulch.png\|32px]]  [[Items/Amaze Mulch]] | 200 [[File:currency/farmPoint.svg\|24px]]  | Increases the growth and mutation rates by 25% and the harvest rate and replant chance  by 50%.  |
|[[File:Freeze_Mulch.png\|32px]]  [[Items/Freeze Mulch]] | 350 [[File:currency/farmPoint.svg\|24px]]  | Pauses Berry growth and auras. This includes the Colbur berry blocking Kasib berries from mutating, but not parasitic effects since those are strictly a mutation.  |
|[[File:Gooey_Mulch.png\|32px]]  [[Items/Gooey Mulch]] | 100 [[File:currency/farmPoint.svg\|24px]]  | Improves the catch rate of wandering Pokémon on mulched plot by 10%. Also increases the weights of berry or color specific wandering Pokémon, making them more likely to appear.  |
|[[File:Berry_Shovel.png\|32px]]  [[Items/Berry Shovel]] | 300 [[File:currency/farmPoint.svg\|24px]]  | Clears an occupied plot instantly. Harvestable plots that are shoveled are harvested and not cleared. |
|[[File:Mulch_Shovel.png\|32px]]  [[Items/Mulch Shovel]] | 300 [[File:currency/farmPoint.svg\|24px]]  | Removes Mulch from a plot in the Farm. |

## Mutating Berries

New berry species can be obtained by [mutation](#!Berries#mutation) by planting specific formations on the Farm.  Mutation is explained on the [[Berries]] page.

## Farm Setups

Thanks to certain Berries having helpful auras, it's possible to use them to achieve different goals. These Setups can be found in:
- [[Hatchery]]: Setups related to Egg Step gain
- [[Shiny Chance]]: Setups related to increasing Shiny Chance
- [[Pokérus]]: Setups related to increasing EV Yield
- [[Farm/Setups]]: Setups not contained in the previous two pages
