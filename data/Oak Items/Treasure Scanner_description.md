While equipped, the Treasure Scanner provides a chance to multiply items mined in the [[Underground]] for both the player and any [Helper](#!Underground_Helpers) mining treasures. It only triggers upon fully uncovering an item. If an item is duplicated it checks again, providing *another* chance to reward the same item. This can happen multiple times, potentially resulting in getting many copies of the same item after uncovering one.  If a duplicated Treasure is kept by a Helper as payment, they will take all the extras as well.  Extra copies of an item created by Treasure Scanner do not grant additional EXP.
