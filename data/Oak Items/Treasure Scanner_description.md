While equipped, the Treasure Scanner provides a chance to multiply items mined in the Underground for both the player and any Helper mining Treasures. It only triggers upon fully uncovering an item. If an item is duplicated it checks again, providing *another* chance to reward the same item. This can happen multiple times, potentially resulting in getting many copies of the same item after uncovering one.  If a duplicated Treasure is kept by a Helper as payment, they will take the extras as well.
