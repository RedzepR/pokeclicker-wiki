## Region Mechanics{#mechanics}

#### Docks (Moving from Region to Region) {#docks}
To visit another region, you must first unlock the **dock** in the region that you are in. When you move to a new region, as you will **not** be able to revisit past regions until reaching a dock in the new region.

Docks in subregions are located in the first town you visit and are automatically unlocked.

#### Unlocking New Regions {#unlock}
Unlocking new regions requires defeating the region's League Champion and, if the Pokédex [Challenge Mode](#!Challenge_Modes) is enabled, catching all the Pokémon in the region's Pokédex. Once you become Champion, all missing regional Pokémon will automatically show up in your Pokédex. *Note: Only certain Pokémon may count toward the regional Pokédex. It does not necessarily include all Pokémon that can be acquired in a region.*


#### Regional Debuff{#debuff}
The Regional Debuff is one of two recommended [[Challenge Modes]] for all players.

[[Pokémon]] that are not native to a region receive a damage debuff. The regional debuff cuts Pokémon's attack by 100% when outside of their Native Region, reduced by 10% per region visited. This effectively means non-native Kanto Pokémon have only 20% of their Attack when battling in Johto. Kanto and Johto Pokémon will have 30% Attack when fighting in Hoenn, 40% in Sinnoh, etc.

This penalty becomes less and less notable as new regions are reached, as the regional debuff decreases and the player has access to more and more Pokémon.

## Available Regions {#availableregions}

#### [[Regions/Kanto]]
Kanto is the first region and introduces the player to the core gameplay features. There are 151 unique Pokémon to catch and breed. Step by step the player gets introduced to the mechanics of breeding and hatching Pokémon, digging up items in the Underground, growing [[Berries]] on the [[Farm]], finishing Quests, the usage of [[Oak Items]], [[Gems]], and Achievements.

By giving [[Items/Protein]] to obtained Pokémon the amount of added damage per breeding cycle is increased, but the number of egg steps also increases. Protein becomes available towards the end of Kanto at the [[Towns/Indigo Plateau Kanto]].

A feature in Kanto is the [[Towns/Safari Zone]], where the player can freely move and catch Pokémon with the support of throwing rocks increase the capture chance and feeding bait to decrease the fleeing chance of encountered Pokémon.

#### [[Regions/Johto]]
Johto is the second region where the player can catch another 100 unique Pokémon. The newly introduced feature in this region is the breeding queue.
This is the first region where the damage debuff becomes noticeable. Any non-native Pokémon receives a damage debuff based on the number of discovered regions. Each discovered and visited region including Kanto decreases the debuff by 10%. E.g. if the overall damage of the Pokémon was 10,000 in Kanto, it will decrease to 2,000 in Johto. Pokémon that are native to Johto deal 100% of their damage in Johto. Upon moving to Kanto via the Dock, it is vice versa. Johto-native Pokémon deal only 20% of their damage in Kanto, while the Kanto-native Pokémon deal 100% in their native region.

The breeding queue allows the player to queue up 4 Pokémon besides the 4 currently breeding eggs. As soon as the Pokémon are queued up, their damage is no longer added to the overall damage of the team until they are either bred and hatched or otherwise removed from the queue.
In Johto the player has the opportunity to get another Oak item to boost the farm.

A safari zone is also present in Johto named [[Towns/National Park]] where a new currency can be earned, which is used for purchasing Pokémon.

[[Items/Calcium]] becomes available for purchase, which increases damage when bred by a percentage of attack, rather than by a flat increase. Finally, completing Hoenn offers access to [[Regions/Orre]] as well as [[Regions/Sevii 4567]].

In the Battle Frontier the player can take a challenge and win great prizes, including 4 unique Pokémon. It is not necessary for the progression to Sinnoh to capture these Pokémon from the [[Battle Frontier]].
