In **Shops**, various currencies can be exchanged for useful items such as Evolution Items, Eggs, and Pokéballs.

The prices shown in the tables below reflect the base prices of each item. When bought in bulk, items increase in price by various amounts. With the exception of Masterballs and Vitamins, the price of shop items can be decreased back to their base price by defeating Pokémon on routes, Gyms, and Dungeons.



If you are buying more than 100 items the price increases as follows

$$ \text{Total Price} =  \text{Round}\Bigg(\text{Item Price} \times \frac{1-1.00045^{\text{Number of Items}}}{1-1.00045}\Bigg)
